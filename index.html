                    <div class="about">
                        <p>My name is Kalob Carter. I was born and raised in Mont Belvieu, Texas, a small town east of Houston. 
                        I spent most of my time after graduating high school working various restaurant jobs, and after moving to Colorado I made a switch to selling phones.
                        That wasn't my destiny of course and no way to survive in Denver so I enrolled in coding bootcamp at the University of Denver.
                        I hope to obtain as much knowledge about coding and web development as possible by the time I'm through with the class so I can enter a new career with all of the tools necessary to excel.</p>
